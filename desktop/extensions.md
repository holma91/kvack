in the homepage, you can add extensions. What does it mean to add an extension?

- you just log onto the site

every extension has:

- a shortcut (e.g g for google and c for chatGPT)

so if you have google and chatGPT installed, you can:

- set up a Google-ChatGPT View with some settings:
  - the dimensions for respective view

you can then do:

- !gc whatever query/question

the query will then get forwarded to both the google and chatgpt BrowserView
