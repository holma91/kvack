STEPS when adding a integration:

1. create extension and add to extensions map
2. create a group including the extension
3. add the group to the settings
4. add necessary things to forge.config.ts
5. create preload file
6. add necessary things to Search.tsx
7. study the html/css and add stuff to the preload (css and js)
